# Introduction to Cypress - Test Automation University

This repository documents my learning on the course [Introduction to Cypress course on Test Automation university](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/cypress-getting-started/).

## Application Under Test

A clone of the popular [Trello app](https://trello.com).

You can...

- Create boards, lists and cards
- Drag and drop cards between lists or even upload a picture to the card detail
- Sign up and log in to create private boards.

For more information, please refer to the original repo created by Filip Hric: https://github.com/filiphric/cypress-basics-tau.

## What I learned

- Chapter 1 - What is Cypress
- Chapter 2 - Installation and Project Walkthrough
- Chapter 3 - First command
- Chapter 4 - Cypress Studio
- Chapter 5 - Selectors
- Chapter 6 - Interactions
- Chapter 7 - Assertions
- Chapter 8 - Chaining and Retrying
- Chapter 9 - Plugins (I skipped this one, I didn't want to sign up to Applitools lol)
- Chapter 10 - Run mode

## Goal

This place is a demonstration of my skills based on what I learned. My aim was not to create a replica of the original repo. I only included meaningful tests here, removing anything that looked like drills or exercises. For example, I deleted the one that only contained `cy.visit("/");`.
